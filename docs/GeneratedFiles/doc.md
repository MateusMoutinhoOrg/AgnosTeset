# GeneratedFiles

`once` = written the first time, then yours to edit. `always` = rewritten by every
`agnos build`, so an edit to it is lost — change the declaration it is rendered from instead.

| File | Written by | Rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| `AgnosConfig/{project,themes,structure,paths}.yaml` | `start` | once |
| `AgnosConfig/extensions.yaml` | `start` | once, then rewritten by `enable-extension` / `disable-extension` and every `<x>-init` / `<x>-purge` — never by hand |
| `AgnosConfig/docs/ReadmeHeader.md` | `start` | once. The whole of `README.md` above the doc index, itself a template |
| `go.mod` | `start` | once. `add-dep` / `remove-dep` edit `require` |
| `go.sum` | `go mod tidy` | - |
| `LICENSE` | `start` | once. A placeholder; its text is pasted into `README.md`'s License section |
| `README.md` | `build` | always. `ReadmeHeader.md` + one index section per theme of `themes.yaml` |
| `sandbox/new.go` | `build` | always. One `<x>.Constructor(&self)` per directory of `sandbox/constructors/` |
| `sandbox/constructors/<x>/constructor.go` | `build` | once, per contract of `sandbox/api/` that has a `sandbox/internal/<x>/new.go`. Then yours — write your own package there and `new.go` calls it too |
| `sandbox/api/sandbox.go` | `build` | always. Every struct of `sandbox/api/<x>sandbox.go` embedded, plus `Config` and `Deps` while the project carries the deps layer |

| `sandbox/api/projectsandbox.go` | `start` | once. `api.ProjectSandbox`, embedded in `api.Sandbox` — declare the project's own fields of the sandbox there |

| `sandbox/deps/deps.go` | `build` | always. One `<Field> <dir>.Contract` per dir of `sandbox/deps/` (`<dir>.Sandbox` for a remote dep, which keeps the name of the api it copies) |
| `adapters/bindings/<name>/new.go` | `build` | always. One `<adapter>.Bind(&deps)` per entry of that binding's `binding.yaml`; a binding with no `binding.yaml` is hand-written and left alone |
| `adapters/bindings/<name>/binding.yaml` | `deps-init` | once, then rewritten by `add-dep` / `remove-dep` — never by hand |
| `sandbox/deps/<dep>/*.go`, `adapters/impls/<adapter>/*.go` | `add-dep` | once |
| `adapters/impls/<adapter>/adapter.yaml` | `add-dep` | once |
| `sandbox/deps/<dep>/*.go` of a remote dep | `add-dep <module>` | rewritten by `set-dep`; a copy of that module's `sandbox/api/` |

| `sandbox/internal/commands/<name>/command.yaml` | `add-command` | once, then rewritten by `add-flag` / `add-arg` / `set-command`, their `set-` editors and their inverses — never by hand |

| `sandbox/internal/cli/errors/handle_*.go` | `build` | once. Five files, one per failure — what this project answers when no command does |
| `sandbox/internal/commandprops/commandprops.go` | `build` | always. `commandprops.CommandProps`, what one command line's chain of commands shares: every struct of the package embedded |
| `sandbox/internal/commandprops/project.go` | `build` | once, while the package has no other part. `Project`, the project's own fields of `CommandProps` |
| `sandbox/api/{server.go,route.go}` | `build` | always. Aliases of the `OpinionatedAgnosServer` contract's types |

| `sandbox/deps/OpinionatedAgnosServer/`, `adapters/impls/OpinionatedAgnosServer/` | `server-init` | once, like any dep. The request chain, the binder, the json-schema validator and the writers every route runs through |

| `docs/{RouteYaml,Routes,ServerUsage}/` | `build` | always. Both `doc.md` and `doc.yaml` |
| `docs/Routes/<route>.md` | `build` | always. One page per visible route; `docs/Routes/doc.md` indexes them |

| `sandbox/internal/routes/<name>/route.yaml` | `add-route` | once, then rewritten by `set-route` / `add-path` / `add-parameter` / `set-body` / `add-body-field` / `import-body`, their `set-` editors and their inverses — never by hand |

Everything under `sandbox/internal/generated/` is `always`. Everything not listed is yours:
`sandbox/internal/<pkg>/`, the contracts under `sandbox/api/`
and `sandbox/deps/` that you write, their `sandbox/internal/<x>/new.go` and `adapters/impls/`
halves, and any
directory of `adapters/bindings/` other than `standard`.
