# Routes

Every address this server answers. Open one to see what to send, a request you can run as it is,
and what comes back.

The requests call `localhost:3000`, where `teste start-server` listens when that port is free —
it prints the address it took. Change it to wherever your server runs.

## How to read an address

| In the address | Means | For example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET`, `POST`, … | the method to send it with; `ANY` takes every one | `curl -X POST …` |
| `/users` | exactly that text | `/users` |
| `{name}` | a value you choose | `/users/{tenant}` -> `/users/acme` |
| `{name:integer}` | a value of that type: `integer`, `number` or `uuid` | `/articles/{id:integer}` -> `/articles/42` |
| `{*name}` | the rest of the address, one part or more | `/files/{*file}` -> `/files/a/b.png` |
| `*` | anything else, or nothing | `/admin/*` -> `/admin`, `/admin/users` |
| `(a\|b)` | one of these words | `/(en\|pt)` -> `/en` |

## Middleware

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`ANY /admin/{*Rest}`](adminmiddlware.md) |  |
| [`ANY /api/admin/{*Rest}`](apimiddleware.md) |  |

## api

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`POST /api/admin/add-user`](apiadduser.md) |  |
| [`POST /api/admin/remove-user/{Id:integer}`](apieremoveuser.md) |  |
| [`GET /api/admin/list-users`](apilistusers.md) |  |
| [`POST /api/admin/update-user/{Id:integer}`](apiupdateuser.md) |  |

## Assets

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`GET /{*Rest}`](frontend.md) | Serves any file of the embedded assets/frontend tree |

## Server

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`GET /health`](health.md) | Reports that the server is up |

## frontend

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`GET /admin/login`](login.md) |  |

## When something goes wrong

| Status | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | Something you sent is missing or has the wrong type or format |
| `401` | You have to identify yourself first — a token, for example |
| `403` | You are identified, but not allowed to do this |
| `404` | No route answers this address |
| `405` | The address exists, but not for this method — a `GET` where it takes a `POST`, for example |
| `413` | The body is too large |
| `415` | The body is not in the format the route reads — check `Content-Type` |
| `500` | The server failed while answering |

Unless the project changed it, the answer to an error is JSON naming what went wrong and, when
it is one value, which one:

```json
{"error": "required parameter 'authorization' is missing", "field": "authorization"}
```

For developers: each page is generated on every build from
`sandbox/internal/routeslist/<name>/route.yaml` ([RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md)); hidden routes
are left out. `agnos list-routes` prints the routes in the order they run, and
`agnos explain-route <METHOD> <path>` which ones a request reaches. The error answers are
the eight files of `sandbox/internal/server/errors/` ([RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#failures)).
