# `GET /{*Rest}`

Serves any file of the embedded assets/front tree

## Try it

Only what is required:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/my-rest
```

With every value it reads:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/my-rest \
  -H 'x-client-ip: my-x-client-ip' \
  -H 'x-forwarded-for: my-x-forwarded-for'
```

## In the address

| Part | What goes there | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{*Rest}` | the rest of the address — one part or more, like `a/b.png` | `my-rest` | the file under assets/front; none is its index.html |

## Query string, headers and cookies

| Name | Sent in | What goes there | Required | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x-client-ip` | header | text | no | `my-x-client-ip` | the ip of the connection, set by the server and never by the client — read by [`backoffice-client-ip`](backoffice_client_ip.md), which runs first |
| `x-forwarded-for` | header | text | no | `my-x-forwarded-for` | the client chain a reverse proxy appended to, read only with --allow-x-forwarded-for — read by [`backoffice-client-ip`](backoffice_client_ip.md), which runs first |

## What comes back

| Status | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | It worked. The answer comes as `text/html; charset=utf-8`. |

Any route may also answer `404`, `405` or `500`: see [when something goes wrong](doc.md#when-something-goes-wrong).

## Runs first

These routes run before this one, on the same request. Any of them may refuse it — with `401`
or `403`, for example — or let it through to this route.
