# Workflow

Every change this project takes and the command that makes it. `agnos` owns every generated
file; what stays hand-written is listed in [GeneratedFiles](../GeneratedFiles/doc.md), and the
rules each recipe holds to are in [Rules](../Rules/doc.md).

## The loop

```bash
agnos build      # verify + regenerate every generated file + go mod tidy + compile
agnos verify     # the schema check alone, writes nothing
```

`build` is the only thing that regenerates the dispatch, the wiring,
`README.md` and `docs/`, so run it after every hand edit. It is idempotent: a second run leaves
the tree unchanged. Every command below takes `--path <dir>` (default `.`) and `-q`, and runs
`build` for you.

No recipe below asks for a Go file to be created by hand except the cases listed under
[Hand-written code](#hand-written-code).

## Choose what agnos generates

```bash
agnos list-extensions             # every generation mechanic and whether it is on
agnos enable-extension readme     # start generating README.md again
agnos disable-extension doc       # stop generating docs/, keep what is there
```

`AgnosConfig/extensions.yaml` is what `build` reads to decide what to render. Turning a
mechanic off stops the generation and removes nothing: the files stay, and they are yours to
edit. Every key is in [Extensions](../Extensions/doc.md).

## Change the command surface

```bash
agnos add-command <name> --help "one line" --category "Core"
agnos add-flag <name> --command <cmd> --type string --description "..." [--default . | --required]
agnos add-arg  <name> --command <cmd> --type int --min 1 --description "..."
agnos set-command <cmd> --long-description "..." --example "<cmd> --flag v" --identifier <alias>
agnos remove-flag <name> --command <cmd>
agnos remove-arg  <name> --command <cmd>
agnos remove-command <cmd>
```

`add-command` writes `sandbox/internal/commands/<name>/entries.yaml` (the declaration) and a
stub `handler.go` (yours), then generates `new.go` — the `api.Command` that joins
`Cli.Commands`. Every key these editors write is in
[EntriesYaml](../EntriesYaml/doc.md); never edit `entries.yaml` by hand.

Then write `handler.go` — the whole hand-written half of a command:

```go
func CommandHandler(sandbox *api.Sandbox, command *api.Command) int {
	if err := something(sandbox, command.GetString("path")); err != nil {
		sandbox.Deps.Std.Error("%s\n", err.Error())
		return api.ExitFailure
	}
	sandbox.Deps.Std.Printf("%s\n", result)
	return api.ExitOk
}
```

Every value arrives typed, defaulted and range-checked: bad input already exited 2 before the
handler ran. [Commands](../Commands/doc.md) documents the command on the next build.


## Change the route surface

```bash
agnos add-route <name> --pattern '/users/{id:integer}' --method POST --help "one line" --category "Users"
agnos add-route <name> --trigger /admin --trigger-type prefix   # /admin and under, never /administrator
agnos add-route <name> --middleware --trigger /admin --before <route>
agnos set-route <route> --method PUT --response-type text/plain --example "curl localhost:8080/users"
agnos add-path <id> --route <route> --start 1 --end 1 --type integer   # one slice of the path
agnos add-path <id> --route <route> --start 0 --end 0 --trigger /v1
agnos add-parameter <name> --route <route> --font header --required
agnos add-parameter <name> --route <route> --type integer --default 1
agnos set-body <route> --type json --required --max-bytes 2097152
agnos add-body-field <dotted.name> --route <route> --format email --required
agnos import-body <route> --file payload.json --required --infer-format
agnos set-path <id> --route <route> --end -1                  # and set-parameter
agnos set-body-field <dotted.name> --route <route> --max 130 --clear format
agnos show-route <route>                                      # the whole declaration as a tree
agnos list-routes                                             # the chain, in run order
agnos explain-route GET /admin/users --header authorization=x   # which routes one request reaches
agnos rename-route <route> <name>
agnos rebalance-routes --step 10                              # room between the rungs again
agnos remove-parameter <name> --route <route>                 # and remove-path
agnos remove-body-field <dotted.name> --route <route>
agnos remove-route <route>
```

`add-route` writes `sandbox/internal/routeslist/<name>/route.yaml` (the declaration, `priority`
and `response-type` always included — `100` for a route, `10` for a `--middleware`) and a stub
`InternalPureHandler.go` (yours), then
generates `new.go` — the `api.Route` that lands in `Server.Routes`, a 1:1 image of the yaml —
and `entries.go` — the `Entries` the handler is handed.
One editor per place the declaration holds something, so every key of
[RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md) is reachable from the command line and `route.yaml` is never
edited by hand. `add-body-field` takes a dotted path (`address.city`) and creates the objects
it passes through; `set-body` covers the envelope around the schema — how the body is read,
whether it is required, its size limit and its content-type.

Each `add-` has a `set-` beside it, so a key that was forgotten is added to the declaration
that is there instead of removing it and declaring it again: the keys given are written over
the ones already declared, `--clear <key>` takes one off, and the result goes through the same
constructor the `add-` side calls. `import-body` is `add-body-field` run once per key of an
example payload — a document pasted with `--json` or read with `--file`, inferring a type per
key, the objects and lists around them and, with `--infer-format`, the four formats a string
may spell; it never writes over a property already declared, and `--replace` starts the schema
over. `show-route` prints the whole declaration as a tree, `list-routes` the chain, and
`explain-route` which routes one request reaches and why the others are skipped — the three
write nothing, and `explain-route` is the first step when a route does not run.

Then write `InternalPureHandler.go` — the whole hand-written half of a route:

```go
func InternalPureHandler(sandbox *api.Sandbox, route *api.Route, entries *Entries, response *serverdeps.Response) error {
	body, err := ReadBody(sandbox, route)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	response.SetStatus(api.StatusCreated)
	response.Write(payload(sandbox, create(sandbox, entries.Tenant, body)))
	return nil
}
```

`entries` arrives bound and converted — one field per path and per parameter, named by its id —
so a bad request was already answered `400` before the handler ran. The body is the exception —
it is read only when `ReadBody` asks for it.

Setting a status or writing a byte is what answers the request. Several routes may match one
request; they run in `priority` order and stop at the first one that answers, so a handler that
does neither has declined and the next one runs — that is the whole of what a middleware is, and
`route.Locals` carries what it learned to the routes after it. What no route answers is answered
by the eight `sandbox/internal/server/errors/handle_*.go`, which `build` writes once and no build
rewrites: they are where a 404, a 405, a 401 or a 500 is worded.
[Routes](../Routes/doc.md) documents the route on the next build, and
[ServerUsage](../ServerUsage/doc.md) is the whole recipe.


## Change the page surface

```bash
agnos add-page <name> --title "One Line"   # assets/frontend/<name>.html, answered on /<name>
agnos remove-page <name>                   # deletes the html
```

A page is a file of `assets/frontend/`, served as it is by the `frontend` route: write it by
hand, scaffold it with `add-page`, or point a bundler's output there. Data comes from api
routes the page's js calls. [FrontUsage](../FrontUsage/doc.md) is the whole recipe.

## Add the database layer

```bash
agnos database-init                     # the store contract, databaseio, the mechanic on
agnos add-database app-database         # the first database
agnos add-table url --database app-database
```

From there `add-table-field` declares what a table holds and every method it generates is
written for you. `agnos database-purge` removes the layer again.
## Add reusable logic

`sandbox/internal/<pkg>/`, one directory per concern, imported by whatever needs it. No
declaration, no generated counterpart — write the package and run `build`.

## Add a surface to the sandbox api

The api is what a Go caller gets back from `sandbox.New` (see [LibUsage](../LibUsage/doc.md)).
Two hand-written places, then `build` regenerates `sandbox/api/sandbox.go` and
`sandbox/new.go` around them:

1. `sandbox/api/<x>.go` — the contract: `type <X> struct { ... }` of function fields, named
   after the file, every declaration doc-commented (those comments render
   [PublicApi](../PublicApi/doc.md)). It becomes the `api.Sandbox` field `<X>`.
2. `sandbox/internal/<x>/new.go` — `func New<X>(sandbox *api.Sandbox) api.<X>`, assigning each
   field of the contract, with the implementation beside it.

`build` then writes `sandbox/constructors/<x>/constructor.go` — `sandbox.<X> =
<x>.New<X>(sandbox)` — **once**, and `sandbox/new.go` calls it. From there the constructor is
yours: wrap the implementation, decorate the contract, or build a different one entirely.

## Construct a field yourself

`sandbox/new.go` is one `<x>.Constructor(&self)` per directory of `sandbox/constructors/`, so
adding a directory is adding a call. Write `sandbox/constructors/<x>/constructor.go` with
`func Constructor(sandbox *api.Sandbox)` in `package <x>`, run `build`, and it is wired — the
same way a generated one is, and with no generated file to fight over. Editing a constructor
`build` wrote earlier works for the same reason: nothing rewrites it.

## Add a dependency

Everything the sandbox is not allowed to do itself — filesystem, clock, network, subprocess —
arrives through `sandbox.Deps`. Install a ready-made one:

```bash
agnos list-deps                 # every installable contract
agnos add-dep <dep>             # sandbox/deps/<dep>/ + its default adapter + the go.mod require
agnos add-dep <dep> --adapter <adapter>
agnos remove-dep <dep> [--with-adapters]
```

[DepList](../DepList/doc.md) is the catalogue. For one of your own, write the two halves:

1. `sandbox/deps/<x>/<x>.go` — `type Sandbox struct { ... }` of function fields, no import at all.
2. `adapters/libs/<x>/<x>.go` — `func Bind(deps *deps.Deps) { deps.<X> = <x>.Sandbox{...} }`, any
   import allowed, beside an `adapter.yaml` saying `dep: <x>`.

Then bind it: add `<x>` to `adapters/availables/standard/available.yaml`, or let
`agnos add-dep` do both for a dep of the catalogue. Reach it as `sandbox.Deps.<X>`
from anywhere inside `sandbox/`.

One contract may have several adapters — see [Adapters](../Adapters/doc.md).

## Add a doc

```bash
agnos add-doc <Name> --theme <id> --description "one line"    # themes: AgnosConfig/themes.yaml
agnos add-doc <Name>/<Sub> --description "one line"           # sub-doc, no theme
agnos remove-doc <Name>
```

Write `docs/<Name>/doc.md`; `README.md`'s index, and the parent `Index.md` of a sub-doc, are
regenerated. Describe any new path worth naming in `AgnosConfig/structure.yaml` — that
file is what renders [Structure](../Structure/doc.md).

## Add an example

```bash
agnos add-cli-example <name>       # examples/cli/<name>/example.sh
agnos add-lib-example <name>       # examples/lib/<name>/example.go
agnos exec-test                    # run them all, check each against its golden
agnos exec-test --only <name>      # one example, both sides
agnos update-test <name>           # rewrite that one golden with what it produces now
agnos exec-test --update           # rewrite every golden at once
agnos remove-cli-example <name>
agnos remove-lib-example <name>
```

Write the example itself, ending with the copy out of `TestDir` into `AssertDir` that says what
it asserts: `result.yaml` records `AssertDir`, and an example that copies nothing out fails.
The golden is written by the first `exec-test` and refreshed with `update-test <name>`, which
prints what it changes before writing. Details in [LibExamples](../LibExamples/doc.md) and
[CliExamples](../CliExamples/doc.md).

## Hand-written code

| File | Written when |
| --- | --- |
| `sandbox/internal/commands/<name>/handler.go` | a command does something |
| `sandbox/internal/routeslist/<name>/InternalPureHandler.go` | a route answers something |
| `assets/frontend/**` | the site looks like something |
| `sandbox/internal/<pkg>/*.go` (never under `generated/`) | logic worth reusing |
| `sandbox/api/<x>.go` + `sandbox/internal/<x>/new.go` | a new api surface |
| `sandbox/constructors/<x>/constructor.go` | how a field of the `Sandbox` is built |
| `sandbox/deps/<x>/<x>.go` + `adapters/libs/<x>/<x>.go` + its `adapter.yaml` | a new dependency |

Everything else is regenerated over. Two more files are yours: `AgnosConfig/docs/ReadmeHeader.md`
is the whole of `README.md` above the documentation index, and `LICENSE` is pasted verbatim into
its License section — put whatever license you want there.

A project built before `sandbox/internal/generated/` existed keeps its old copies: after the
first `build`, `git rm -r` whichever of `sandbox/internal/{cli,config,routeio,frontio,databaseio}`
and `sandbox/internal/server/{route,server}` it holds, and point every hand-written import of
`sandbox/internal/{routeio,frontio,databaseio}` at `sandbox/internal/generated/<same>`.

## Ship

```bash
agnos compile --target all   # cross-compile ./cmd/main into release/
agnos publish                # build, compile, then a gh release
```

`go build -o release/teste ./cmd/main` is the plain local binary.
`publish` names the release after `version` in `AgnosConfig/project.yaml`; bump it there
first. `compile` targets: `linux86`, `linuxarm64`, `linuxi32`, `mac86`, `macarm64`,
`windows86`, `windowsi32`, or `all`.
