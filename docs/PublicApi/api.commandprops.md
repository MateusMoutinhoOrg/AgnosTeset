## `CommandProps`

CommandProps is what one command line carries from the commands that run on it to the ones after them: the dispatch builds one, empty, per command line, and hands the same one to every InternalPureHandler of the chain as its first argument. A middleware that parsed a --path or a --profile sets it here, and the command it runs in front of reads it: type CommandProps struct { Path string } Written once by `agnos build` and then yours: declare the fields your middlewares hand on. No build rewrites this file once it is there.
