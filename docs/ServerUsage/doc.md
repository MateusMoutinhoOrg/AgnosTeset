# ServerUsage

The server layer mirrors the cli layer file for file: `sandbox/internal/routes/<name>/` is to a
route what `sandbox/internal/commands/<name>/` is to a command, and `route.yaml` is to it what
`entries.yaml` is to a command.

| Concept | CLI | Server |
|---|---|---|
| External input contract | `sandbox/deps/argvdeps/` | `sandbox/deps/serverdeps/` |
| Dispatch | `sandbox/internal/cli/climain.go` | `sandbox/internal/server/servermain.go` |
| Declared unit | `commands/<name>/entries.yaml` | `routes/<name>/route.yaml` |
| Generated declaration | `new.go` -> `NewCommand` | `new.go` -> `NewRoute` |
| Surface on the sandbox | `Cli.Commands` | `Server.Routes` |
| Built by | `sandbox/internal/cli/new.go` | `sandbox/internal/server/new.go` |
| Hand-written half | `handler.go` -> `CommandHandler` | `handler.go` -> `RouteHandler` |
| Install / remove | `cli-init` / `cli-purge` | `server-init` / `server-purge` |

## Bring it up

```bash
agnos server-init  # serverdeps, the server layer, the health route, start-server
Url-Shortner start-server  # listens on :8080
Url-Shortner start-server --addr :3000 --read-timeout-ms 30000
curl localhost:8080/health
```

`server-init` installs the CLI layer first when the project has none — a server needs a command
that starts it. `server-purge` removes the server layer again and leaves the CLI in place.

A Go caller skips the command entirely:

```go
sandbox := sandbox.New(&deps)
err := sandbox.Server.Serve(api.ServeProps{Addr: ":8080", ReadTimeoutMs: 10000, WriteTimeoutMs: 10000})
```

`Serve` blocks until the server stops.

## Declare a route

```bash
agnos add-route create-user --trigger /users --method POST --help "Create a user" --category Users
agnos add-segment tenant --route create-user
agnos add-header authorization --route create-user --required
agnos add-param page --route create-user --type int --default 1 --min 1
agnos set-body create-user --type json --required
agnos add-body-field email --route create-user --format email --required
agnos remove-param page --route create-user
agnos remove-route create-user
```

`add-route` writes `route.yaml` (the declaration) and a stub `handler.go` (yours); `build`
generates `new.go`, the `api.Route` that lands in `Server.Routes`. One editor per place the
declaration holds something — `add-segment`, `add-header`, `add-param`, `set-body`,
`add-body-field`, `set-route`, each with its `remove-` inverse — so every key of
[RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md) is reachable from the command line and `route.yaml` is never
edited by hand.

`add-segment` takes `--identifier /users` for a literal segment, or a name for a capture; an
identifier is normalized to start with `/`, and an inner or trailing slash is refused. With
`--array` the capture takes every segment left in the path
(`agnos add-segment rest --route static --array` matches `/static/a/b.png`), which
only the last segment of a route may do.
`add-body-field` takes a dotted path (`address.city`), creating the intervening objects in the
`json-schema`.

## Write the handler

```go
func RouteHandler(sandbox *api.Sandbox, route *api.Route, response serverdeps.Response) int {
	// the body has not been read yet — refuse early if you can
	if !isAuthorized(sandbox, route.GetString("authorization")) {
		return routeio.WriteError(sandbox, response, api.StatusFailure, "", "not authorized")
	}
	body, status := ReadBody(sandbox, route, response)
	if status != api.StatusOk {
		return status
	}
	return writeJson(sandbox, response, api.StatusCreated, createUser(sandbox, route.GetString("tenant"), body))
}
```

`route` arrives bound, converted and range-checked; a bad request was already answered `400`
before the handler ran. Every value is read back by the name its declaration gives it —
`GetString`, `GetInt`, `GetFloat`, `GetBool`, and `GetStrings`/`GetInts`/`GetFloats` for an
array ([RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#reading-the-values)). The handler returns the status it
answered with, and propagates the one `ReadBody` gives it. [Routes](../Routes/doc.md) documents
the route on the next build.

A Go caller reads the same surface without a socket: `Server.Routes` is every declared route,
in match order, and `api.BindRoute` copies one into the route a single request runs on.
