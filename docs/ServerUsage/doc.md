# ServerUsage

The server layer mirrors the cli layer file for file: `sandbox/internal/routes/<name>/` is to a
route what `sandbox/internal/commands/<name>/` is to a command, and `route.yaml` is to it what
`entries.yaml` is to a command.

| Concept | CLI | Server |
|---|---|---|
| External input contract | `sandbox/deps/argvdeps/` | `sandbox/deps/serverdeps/` |
| Dispatch | `sandbox/internal/cli/climain.go` | `sandbox/internal/server/servermain.go` |
| Declared unit | `commands/<name>/entries.yaml` | `routes/<name>/route.yaml` |
| Generated declaration | `new.go` -> `NewCommand` | `new.go` -> `NewRoute` |
| Surface on the sandbox | `Cli.Commands` | `Server.Routes` |
| Built by | `sandbox/internal/cli/new.go` | `sandbox/internal/server/new.go` |
| Hand-written half | `handler.go` -> `CommandHandler` | `handler.go` -> `RouteHandler` |
| Answer to bad input | the dispatch, exit 2 | `sandbox/internal/server/handle_*.go`, yours |
| Install / remove | `cli-init` / `cli-purge` | `server-init` / `server-purge` |

## Bring it up

```bash
agnos server-init  # serverdeps, the server layer, the health route, start-server
NewRoutes start-server  # listens on :8080
NewRoutes start-server --addr :3000 --read-timeout-ms 30000
curl localhost:8080/health
```

`server-init` installs the CLI layer first when the project has none — a server needs a command
that starts it. `server-purge` removes the server layer again and leaves the CLI in place.

A Go caller skips the command entirely:

```go
sandbox := sandbox.New(&deps)
err := sandbox.Server.Serve(api.ServeProps{Addr: ":8080", ReadTimeoutMs: 10000, WriteTimeoutMs: 10000})
```

`Serve` blocks until the server stops.

## Declare a route

```bash
agnos add-route create-user --trigger /users --method POST --help "Create a user" --category Users
agnos add-route logger --trigger / --starts-with --priority 0 --help "Logs every request" --category Server
agnos add-segment tenant --route create-user
agnos add-header authorization --route create-user --required
agnos add-param page --route create-user --type int --default 1 --min 1
agnos set-body create-user --type json --required
agnos add-body-field email --route create-user --format email --required
agnos set-param page --route create-user --max 50
agnos show-route create-user
agnos remove-param page --route create-user
agnos remove-route create-user
```

`add-route` writes `route.yaml` (the declaration) and a stub `handler.go` (yours); `build`
generates `new.go`, the `api.Route` that lands in `Server.Routes`. One editor per place the
declaration holds something — `add-segment`, `add-header`, `add-param`, `set-body`,
`add-body-field`, `set-route`, each with its `remove-` inverse — so every key of
[RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md) is reachable from the command line and `route.yaml` is never
edited by hand.

Each `add-` has a `set-` beside it — `set-segment`, `set-header`, `set-param`,
`set-body-field` — which edits the declaration that is there instead of replacing it: the keys
given are written over the ones already declared, `--clear <key>` takes one off, `--rename`
changes the name it answers to, and the result goes through the same constructor the `add-`
side calls. Adding a `--max` that was forgotten is one command, not a remove and a
re-declaration.

`add-segment` takes `--identifier /users` for a literal segment, `--starts-with /api` for one
the path only has to begin with, or a name for a capture; an identifier is normalized to start
with `/`, and an inner or trailing slash is refused on the exact one. With `--array` the capture
takes every segment left in the path
(`agnos add-segment rest --route static --array` matches `/static/a/b.png`), which
only the last segment of a route may do.

`add-header` and `add-param` take the same two flags, meaning something else there: `--identifier`
and `--starts-with` are conditions on the **value** the request brings, and the route runs only
when they hold ([RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#field-keys)).
`add-body-field` takes a dotted path (`address.city`), creating the intervening objects in the
`json-schema`. `import-body` declares a whole payload at once from an example of it:

```bash
agnos import-body create-user --file payload.json --required --infer-format
agnos import-body create-user --json '{"email":"a@b.co","age":30,"tags":["x"]}'
```

It infers a type per key, the objects and lists around them, `--required` for every key the
example carries, and — with `--infer-format` — the `email`, `uuid`, `date-time` and `uri` a
string spells. A property already declared is never written over; `--replace` starts the schema
over instead. What it infers is a starting point, and every bound after that is
`set-body-field`'s.

`show-route <route>` prints the declaration as a tree — the request line, the segments of the
path, the headers, the query parameters and the body schema property by property, with the
keywords declared on each. It writes nothing and runs no build.

## Write the handler

```go
func RouteHandler(sandbox *api.Sandbox, route *api.Route, response serverdeps.Response) error {
	// the body has not been read yet — refuse early if you can
	if !isAuthorized(sandbox, route.GetString("authorization")) {
		return routeio.Fail(sandbox, route, api.StatusFailure, "", "not authorized")
	}
	body, err := ReadBody(sandbox, route)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	response.SetHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
	response.SetStatus(api.StatusCreated)
	response.Write(payload(sandbox, createUser(sandbox, route.GetString("tenant"), body)))
	return nil
}
```

`route` arrives bound, converted and range-checked; a bad request was already answered `400`
before the handler ran. Every value is read back by the name its declaration gives it —
`GetString`, `GetInt`, `GetFloat`, `GetBool`, and `GetStrings`/`GetInts`/`GetFloats` for an
array ([RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#reading-the-values)).

**Setting a status is what answers the request.** A handler that writes none has declined, and
the next route matching this request runs — that is the whole of what a middleware is. Returning
an error means "I could not answer this", and hands it to `handle_server_error.go`; returning
`nil` means "done" or "not mine", which the written status tells apart.
[Routes](../Routes/doc.md) documents the route on the next build, and
[RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#the-chain) has the chain in full.

## Answer the failures

`server-init` writes six more files into `sandbox/internal/server/`, one per way a request can
end without a route answering it — `handle_not_found.go`, `handle_method_not_allowed.go`,
`handle_bad_request.go`, `handle_too_large.go`, `handle_wrong_content_type.go` and
`handle_server_error.go`. Each is a route handler in every respect and each is yours: written
once, never regenerated. Editing what your server says when nothing matches is editing
`handle_not_found.go` and nothing else. The table and the shape are in
[RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#failures).

A Go caller reads the same surface without a socket: `Server.Routes` is every declared route,
in run order, and `api.BindRoute` copies one into the route a single request runs on.
