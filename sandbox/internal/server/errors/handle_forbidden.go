// HandleForbidden answers a request whose credentials are valid and not
// enough — raised with Deps.OpinionatedAgnosServer.Fail and api.StatusForbidden.
//
// It is a route handler like any other — same signature, it writes the response
// itself, it returns what it could not answer — and it is **yours**: written
// once by `agnos server-init` and never regenerated, so whatever
// you put here is what your server says. The default is the same JSON shape
// every other failure carries, {"error": "...", "field": "..."}.
//
// What went wrong is on `route.Failure`, read through Deps.OpinionatedAgnosServer.FailureOf so a
// route carrying none still answers something. The route itself is bound when a
// declared route raised the failure and bare when none did, so
// route.Request reads the request either way.
//
// Answer a failure here; never raise one: a failure raised from here comes back to this file.
