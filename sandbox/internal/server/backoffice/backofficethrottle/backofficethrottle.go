// Sign-ins and API tokens are counted per client ip, and sign-ins per account
// as well, within a window of WindowSeconds. An attempt is counted *before*
// its password or token is checked — Hit answers the count with it included,
// atomically — so requests sent at the same time can never all pass the
// check before any of them is counted; one that turns out to succeed is taken
// back with Undo. Once a count passes its limit, the attempt is refused with a
// 429, unchecked, until the window closes.
//
// The account is the user the login names — by username or by email, the
// same counter — or, for a login that names nobody, a hash of the login: a key
// never holds what the client typed, so its size is fixed. An ip that signed
// in to an account within TrustedSeconds is counted on its own for that
// account, apart from everyone else: failures sent from other ips never lock
// out the people who use it. The counts live in Deps.RatelimitDeps, in the
