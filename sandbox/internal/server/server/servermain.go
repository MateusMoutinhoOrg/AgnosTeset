// nothing — and hands every request to dispatch, whatever its method or path.
// The first request to stop the process — an interrupt, a termination —
// shuts it down gracefully through sandbox.Deps.Signaldeps: no new request is
// taken, and the ones in flight get ShutdownTimeoutMs to finish, after which
// Listen returns nil.
// Nothing here is generated per route: every route is one declaration built by
// its own NewRoute and collected by sandbox/internal/server/server/new.go, so
// this file is the same in every project.

// dispatch is the whole routing layer: it runs every route of Server.Routes
// the request is for, in the order the collector put them — lowest `priority`
// first. Whether a route is for the request is its own IsActionable's to say;
// binding and running it is its own RequestHandler's.
//
// More than one route may be for one request, which is what a chain is: each
// one runs in turn until one of them **answers** — sets a status, or writes a
// byte, which sends a 200. A handler that does neither has declined, so the
// next route runs — that is the whole of what makes a middleware a
// middleware. A handler that returns an error without answering ends the
// chain too, through HandleServerError. Every route of one request shares one
// Locals, which is how a middleware hands what it learned to the routes after
// it.
//
// Nothing here writes a response itself. Every way a request can end without a
// route answering it — nothing matched, matched under another method, a value
// that will not bind, a panic — is raised through routeio.Fail and answered by
// one of the project's own Handle* files. Once it is answered, whatever
// answered it, the routes of the `after` phase run.
