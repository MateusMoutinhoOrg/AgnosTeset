// While a restore — or the roll-back of one the last run did not finish —
// writes the databases, every request is refused with a 503: none reads a
// half-written database, nor writes into one about to be replaced. While a
// snapshot reads them file by file, a request that may write — any method but
// GET, HEAD and OPTIONS — is refused the same way, so every file of the
// snapshot is taken at one instant. Anything else declines, so the route
// after it runs. A request already past this rung when a job starts is not
// stopped, and neither is a write made outside the server, by a command line.
