// Tracked wraps one response so the dispatch can tell whether a handler
// answered the request. It returns the wrapper to hand to the handlers and a
// reader that reports whether a status has been set on it.
//
// Setting the status is the whole of what ends a chain: a handler that writes
// bytes without one has not answered, and the next route of the chain runs.
// That rule lives here rather than in serverdeps because a dep states what a
// library can do and never what this project does with it — the contract is a
// struct of function fields precisely so the sandbox can wrap it like this.
