// Fail is the one way any part of the server layer raises a failure: it records
// what went wrong on the route and hands it to the project's own handler for
// that status — HandleBadRequest, HandleTooLarge, HandleWrongContentType,
// HandleServerError — through sandbox.Server.Fail.
//
// It goes through the api rather than calling sandbox/internal/server/errors
// because the package that routes to it, sandbox/internal/generated/server/server,
// imports every route package, so no route may import it back. The field on
// the api is what crosses that line, and it is filled by the generated
// sandbox/internal/generated/server/server/new.go.
//
// It returns the error the handler returned — the failure's own message when
// that handler answered it — so an InternalPureHandler ends on one line:
//
//	return routeio.Fail(sandbox, route, api.StatusFailure, "", "not authorized")

// or the value a handler panicked with. The cause reaches the handler on

// FailureOf is the failure one of the project's Handle* files is answering. A
// file stands for one status and one wording, and passes them here as the
// fallback: a failure that carries its own — a field that would not bind, a
// body the schema rejected — answers with that, because it says something no
// file could say in advance, and one that carries none answers with the file's.
//
// That is the split that makes a Handle* file worth editing. The dispatch
// raises "nothing matched" and "method not allowed" with no message at all, so
// the wording comes from handle_not_found.go and handle_method_not_allowed.go
// and changing it there changes what the server says. It also keeps every
// handler free of a nil check.
