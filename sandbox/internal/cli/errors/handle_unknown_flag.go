// HandleUnknownFlag answers a command line carrying a token that looks like a
// flag and that no command of the chain read — a typo such as --pathh, which
// would otherwise leave the command running on a default.
//
// It is a command handler like any other — it prints through the response and
// sets the exit status itself — and it is **yours**: written once by
// `agnos build` and never regenerated, so whatever you put here is
// what your cli says.
//
// What went wrong is on `command.Failure`, read through Deps.OpinionatedAgnosCli.FailureOf so a
// command carrying none still answers something. The command is bound when a
// declared command raised the failure and bare when none did; command.Argv is
// the command line either way.
//
// Answer a failure here; never raise one: a failure raised from here comes back to this file.
