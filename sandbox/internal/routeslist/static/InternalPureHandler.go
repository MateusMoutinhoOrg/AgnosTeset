// cleaned by the embed adapter before the read, so "/static/../asset.go" would
// otherwise reach a file outside pageio.StaticRoot. safeSegments is what forbids
// it: nothing leaves this route that the caller did not name segment by segment
// underneath that directory. This file is yours to edit, and that check is the
// one thing to keep whatever else changes.
//
// `?sha=` is what the pageio helpers stamp on every link they build. It is a
// cache key and never an input: the file that is served is the one the path
// names, whatever the sha says. All it decides is cacheHeader below.
