// InternalPureHandler answers ANY /*. Every value the route
// declares is already on entries, read off the request by the generic
// RequestHandler, and the response already carries the route's response-type.
//
// Answering — setting a status, or writing a byte, which sends a 200 — is what
// ends the chain. A handler that does neither has declined, and the next route
// matching this request runs — which is how a route becomes a middleware.
// What a middleware in front stored is on route.Locals, read with
// routeio.GetLocal. Return a failure you did not answer yourself with
// routeio.Fail; nil means "done" or "not mine".
