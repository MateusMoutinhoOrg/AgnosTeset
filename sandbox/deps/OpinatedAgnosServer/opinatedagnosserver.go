// This package is the contract of an *opinated* lib: unlike every other dep,
// which restates a library's raw capability and nothing more, it carries the
// agnos server mechanic itself — the declaration a route.yaml becomes, the
// chain that runs a request against those declarations, how a value and a
// body are bound and validated, how a failure is raised and written. The
// project's sandbox/api aliases its types, so a handler still reads them as
// api.Route, api.StatusOk.
//
// What stays in the project is everything it declares or edits: each route's
// route.yaml and InternalPureHandler.go, the generated declarations built from
// them, routeprops, and the Handle* files of sandbox/internal/server/errors/.
