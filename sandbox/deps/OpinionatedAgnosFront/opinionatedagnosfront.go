// This package is the contract of an *opinionated* lib: unlike every other dep,
// which restates a library's raw capability and nothing more, it carries the
// agnos front mechanic itself — how a request path maps onto one file of the
// embedded assets/front/ tree, how that path is kept inside the tree, and
// which media type the file is served as. It holds no opinion about what the
// tree is — hand-written html, or the dist/ of any bundler.
//
// What stays in the project is the route that serves the tree
// (routes/front, written once by front-init) and the tree itself.

const (
	// Root is the directory of the embedded asset tree every file is read
	// from, as embeddeps spells a path: slash-separated and relative to the
	// root of the assets package, so "assets/front" on disk.

	// Index is the file a directory is answered with, "/" included.
	Index = "index.html"
	// NotFound is the file a path naming no file is answered with, under a
	// 404. front-init writes it once; it is the project's to restyle.
	NotFound = "404.html"
	// RevalidateCache is the cache header every file is served with: the
	// browser may store the answer but must ask before reusing it, so a new
	// build is picked up on the next load whatever the file is named.

	// Root, trying in order the path itself, the path plus ".html", and the
	// path as a directory holding Index — so /about answers about.html or
	// about/index.html, and / answers index.html. It returns the path
	// relative to Root it read, for ContentTypeOf, and false when the path is
	// unsafe or names nothing, which a caller reads as "not mine".

	// A leading and a trailing slash are dropped; "" names Root itself.

	// ContentTypeOf reads the media type off a file's extension, matched in
	// lower case. An extension nothing claims is served as
	// application/octet-stream rather than guessed at, which also keeps an
	// unknown file from being rendered as html by the browser.
