// the exit status the line was answered with. Whether a command is for the
// line is its Matches's to say; binding and running it is its
// Run's.
//
// More than one command may be for one line, which is what a chain is: each one
// runs in turn until one of them **answers** — sets a status, or prints to
// stdout, which answers ExitOk. A middleware that does neither has declined, so
// the next command runs; a strict command that does neither ran silently, and
// answers ExitOk. A handler that returns an error ends the chain too, answered
// or not, through HandleFailure. Every command of one line is handed one
// CommandProps and one Consumed, which is how a middleware hands what it
// learned, and the tokens it read, to the commands after it.
//
// Nothing here prints itself. Every way a line can end without a command
// answering it — nothing matched, a value that will not bind, a token nobody
// read, a panic — is raised through props.Cli.Fail and answered by one of the
// project's own Handle* files.
